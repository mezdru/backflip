	"Les humains et leurs talents font la performance de l’entreprise. Dans les startups en hypercroissance jusqu’aux grands groupe en transformation, pouvoir les trouver et les valoriser c’est donc stratégique, mais c’est très difficile.<br /><br />Chez Wingzy, on sait que la solution c’est la simplicité : vous avez déjà bien assez d’outils et de process qui entravent vos talents. Alors, on s’est concentré sur l’essentiel : permettre à tous les collaborateurs de se trouver pour partager leurs compétences, expertises et énergies. Rien de plus.<br /><br />Wingzy, c’est donc une app minimaliste pour :<br /><ul><li>Orienter et rassurer, surtout les nouveaux,</li><li>Accélérer la collaboration et l’apprentissage,</li><li>Valoriser et engager grâce au partage de compétences.</li></ul>Et comme Wingzy se diffuse viralement dans votre boite, c’est un quick win !": "crwdns1912:0crwdne1912:0",
